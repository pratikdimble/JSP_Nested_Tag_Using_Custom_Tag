# JSP_Nested_Tag_Using_Custom_Tag
Nested tags are another powerful feature of tag libraries.  You can use nested tags whether the tag implements the Tag or BodyTag interface.  When tags are nested,  it's possible to obtain a reference to the parent class by using the getParent() method.  By casting the reference to the parent class, the nested tag handler can call methods in the parent class.  Another use for the getParent() is to determine what type of tag in which another tag might be nested. It is likely, when building more complicated systems, that a tag handler might need to act differently depending on what the outer tag is.  The tag handler can determine what action to take based on the return value of the getParent(). Nested tags really only effect the tag handler.
